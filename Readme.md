# ToradoraTranslateTool

With this program you will be able to extract ISO, extract game files, translate all the text inside the game, and then repack it all.

## How do I translate the game?

All you need is the game's ISO file. You can use the original Japanese version, or already patched.

After you got the ISO file, just open the program, and start with the first stage. Next to each step there is a button with a question mark, when you click on it, you will get all the necessary information.

The instruction on the images translation is written in Images/HowTo.txt.

The game automatically moves the text to a new line if it doesn't fit into the dialog box, so you don't have to put a line break sign. But if you need to move the text to a new line, insert the symbol Fullwidth Low Line - "＿".
